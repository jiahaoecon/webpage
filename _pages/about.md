​I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics from State University of New York, at Albany. 

​​My research interests center on econometrics, with a particular focus on high-dimensional methods (e.g., bootstrap and jackknife) for panel and time series data. I am also interested in robust inference for panel models, one-way or multiway clustered dependence, fixed effects (individual or time-specific).

My long-term objective is to promote the integration of econometric theory into empirical work by developing inference tools that are both robust and easy to implement.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Koomla Ulrich Hounyo.
