​I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics from State University of New York, at Albany. 

​​My research interests center on econometrics, with a particular focus on high-dimensional methods (e.g., bootstrap and jackknife) for panel and time series data. I am also interested in robust inference for panel models, unobserved heterogeneous effects, fixed effects (individual or time-specific), and one-way or multiway clustered dependence.

My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between econometric theory and empirical practice by delivering inference tools that are both robust and easy to implement.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Koomla Ulrich Hounyo.
